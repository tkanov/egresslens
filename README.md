EgressLens is a proof-of-concept tool for observing outbound network activity from a command run inside a controlled Linux environment (Docker containers). 👷**WIP**👷

It works by launching your command, using `strace` to monitor network syscalls, and capturing connect/send events. These are parsed into a structured JSONL log for basic analysis.

You can explore the results in a web UI to see top destinations, timelines, and generate simple reports. The typical workflow: run, capture, shut down, and analyze.

## Project Structure

- **[cli/](cli/README.md)**  
  Command-line tool for running a user-specified command in a Docker container, tracing its network syscalls with `strace`, and generating JSONL event logs and run metadata. This is the main entrypoint for capturing egress data.

- **[sample_app/](sample_app/README.md)**  
  A tiny Python app used for testing EgressLens. It performs DNS lookups and queries [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/) for certificate transparency entries, providing predictable network activity for demo and test runs.

- **[backend/](backend/README.md)**  
  FastAPI backend (in progress) for uploading, aggregating, and serving reports generated by the CLI. It will provide endpoints for uploading JSONL files, viewing summaries, and exporting reports.
